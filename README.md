# acronym_generator

This is an acronym generator... it takes a list of 'words of interest' and tries to match them up to dictionary words to make acronyms.

Dependencies:
* it looks for a file called "words_of_interest.txt" which you have to provide
* it expects to have "read_english_dictionary.py" and "words_alpha.txt"  from [this repo](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words)
